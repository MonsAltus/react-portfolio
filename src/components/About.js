            <p>
            I'm a MERN stack web developer, and I'm studying at the UCSD Extension for Web Development.
            My background is primarily in precision manufacturing and physical security, and I'm carrying my detail-orientation, organizational, and process-planning skills learned in those fields into software.
            I enjoy merging form and function in each project I'm involved in. I have a passion for problem solving, reworking processes for efficiency, and learning new best practices to compliment my current knowledge.
